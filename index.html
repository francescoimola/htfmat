    <p class="paragraph">Have you ever thought that the idea you have about what home means to you could <nobr>forever
        change?</nobr>
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">Home is something you ran away from or maybe home is something you had your whole life. But
      home will always be
      where your <nobr>story started.</nobr>
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">Home is not a place; it is a feeling&mdash;says Instagram post with <nobr>641 likes.</nobr>
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">Home is where you can be yourself&mdash;at ease, ready to try out <nobr>new stuff.</nobr> Cook
      omelettes, attempt
      baking, burn the tip of your hair or cut all of <nobr>your hair off.</nobr>
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">At home, you can heal.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">But how much of this <nobr>is true?</nobr>
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">For too many people, being happy at home is <nobr>an abstract idea.</nobr> For some, home
      represents conflict,
      loss, <nobr>neglect, trauma.</nobr>
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">Like ghosts who cannot escape, these experiences endure <nobr>in isolation.</nobr>
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">In the secrecy of the home, people are forced to grieve loss and deal with conflict while
      living in <nobr>its
        memory.</nobr>
      <br>I know it from experience. I mean, I grew up in <nobr>that environment.</nobr>
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">As Mary Douglas describes in her paper:
      <span class="emphasis">The Idea of a Home: <nobr>A Kind of Space</nobr></span>
      , a home is not only a space full of domestic things, it also has some structure <nobr>in time.</nobr>
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">From set meal times to rotational access to fixed spaces such as the bathroom or the fridge:
      like a tyran, the
      home demands coordination, synchrony even. Its terms are rigid and its functioning exercises an authoritarian
      control over <nobr>mind and body.</nobr>
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">Remember, a home owes you nothing. Do not expect happiness, comfort, and safe shelter either.
      You can feel safe,
      comfortable, and happy in a camper, caravan, or hotel&mdash;but <nobr>are these homes?</nobr>
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">Our first home is our mother's womb. When we enter the external world our <nobr>
        &quot;residence&quot; changes.
      </nobr> But wherever we are, home always starts with <nobr>our body.</nobr>
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">As we age, our relationship with our body changes. Sometimes we look in the mirror and feel
      disoriented
      &mdash;we look for a person that no <nobr>longer exists.</nobr> It is no wonder we find it difficult to adjust
      to the environment <nobr>around us.</nobr>
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">Thoughts, perspectives, opinions, generational gaps they all find their way inside the home
      through the broken
      window creeks and sit <nobr>on the wall.</nobr><br>People inside the home become distant. We close our doors in
      the hope that someone will knock and say <nobr>&quot;I am here&quot;.</nobr>
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">Yet, a home should be that place where you can start over and over every day. But it takes some
      reconfiguration
      to feel at home again, especially after leaving the home we <nobr>grew up in.</nobr>
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">Feeling at home is the reward we experience after years of work, physical <nobr>and emotional.
      </nobr> Perhaps,
      you always felt at home or never questioned that feeling. Though it is a privilege <nobr>few have.</nobr>
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">What can I do to feel more <nobr>at home?</nobr><br>&mdash;you <nobr>might ask.</nobr>
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">It is a question I have been trying hard to answer&mdash;and while I did, I relocated more
      times than I <nobr>
        wanted
        to.</nobr>
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">Why is it that every time I get to one place, I cannot wait to move <nobr>someplace else?
      </nobr>
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">I learned that feeling at home is about loving yourself and letting go. Three years of therapy
      gone by, and I
      have journeyed within as much as I <nobr>did outward.</nobr>
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="emphasis">They said</span>: Take some time alone each day and use this time to
      check in with <nobr>
        your emotions.</nobr>
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="emphasis">I said</span>: Okay&mdash;but I am still learning about how the
      environment around me
      <nobr>makes me feel.</nobr>
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="emphasis">They said</span>: Develop faith in your <nobr>learning ability.</nobr>
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="emphasis">I said</span>: How can I learn to expand my understanding of what home
      <nobr>means to me?
      </nobr>
    </p>
    <p><span class="emphasis">They said</span>: Think of this process like completing a puzzle. Believe that, even
      though you may not know all you need to feel more at home, if you simply tackle a section of the puzzle
      and learn from that, you will learn enough to solve the next section&mdash;and so on,
      <nobr>until you are done.</nobr>

        who)
        makes one, and how to find meaning living inbetween homes.
