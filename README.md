# How to feel more at home

"How to feel more at home" is a website/poem articulating themes of inclusion, homesickness, and what makes anywhere a home. It is based loosely on Francesco Imola's [are.na channel by the same name](https://www.are.na/francesco-imola-2o2ng4qooxm/how-to-feel-more-at-home).
